# gdoc-cmsify

Turn your Google Docs into a headless CMS

## So what does it do?

Initially the goal is to provide the following functionality

- Given a google doc id, it will return a JSON version of the text nodes in the document
- Given a google drive id, such JSONs will be returned for all the docs
